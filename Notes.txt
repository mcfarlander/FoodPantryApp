History and other notes:

Version 1.0:
    Initial release


Version 1.1:
    Add button on settings window to allow Sue to increment all customer
    numbers by one because the application starts counting at 0 rather than 1.

Version 1.2:
    Changed application title to "McFarland Community Food Pantry", branding.

    If a customer cannot be identified at the visit, Sue requested this be
    bypassed. Instead, the program assigns a -1 to the account and shows the
    entry with a red background. Add custom tablecellrenderer to do this.

Version 1.3.11

	JavaFX must be bundled as per the operating system. For eclipse, add

	the Windows environment. This sucks. If the variable is not defined, 
	the build will use the host operating system.
